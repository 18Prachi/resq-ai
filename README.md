# 🚨 ResQ.AI – AI-Powered Emergency Assistant

**Empowering emergency response for everyone, anywhere.**

---

## 🌐 Overview

In rural or remote areas, accessing emergency help can be difficult due to poor internet, lack of services, or even the inability to describe the situation clearly. **ResQ.AI** solves this with an intelligent, multilingual assistant that classifies emergencies from voice or text, offers first-response guidance, shares your location, and can trigger an SOS with one tap.

> 🧠 Powered by AI & built with accessibility, speed, and reliability at its core.
